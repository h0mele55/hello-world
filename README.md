My First Git Repository
This is one of my first plays with git. So far i am a bit lagging in experience but i compensate with drive and zeal to learn.
I will make it happen. 
Oh yes/

Believe it or not, i am writing this 8 months after creating the master branch. Loads of changes happened since then, i think i was in UK at the time of the initial commit. And now, believe it or not, am in the 3M Sofia office, auditing financial statements. What a change, hey. Will see what the future holds.

Ta-Dah,
Eivo
